# Earthquake-GeoJSON

## Basic Visualization
- Data is taken from USGS which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
- The URL of JSON is used to pull in the data for our visualization

## Import & Visualize the Data
- Creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes for last month based on their longitude and latitude
- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color
- Including popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked
- Creating a legend that provides context for a map data
